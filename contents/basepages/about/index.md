Angela La Salle is a recent graduate of Lambda School's Full Stack Web Development track and a current Team Lead for Labs students at Lambda School. In their off hours, Angela can usually be found reading or playing video games. Their background in education and passion for learning the latest and best in the web development field has informed their approach to guiding students on their team. Angela believes that teaching and mentorship is a field that can be transformative and exciting, and learning web development can be as much of a gift for others as it has been for them.

Angela has been an ambitious and engaged student of web development for the past year. They consistently performed above expectations in coursework and in their capstone project that simulated a professional development team. Angela hopes to bring these experiences and their desire to always learn more with them everywhere they go, now and in the future.
